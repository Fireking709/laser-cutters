Week 1

On the first Week, I researched laser cutters and the different types of laser cutters like CO2, Fiber, Diode, and UV. In the end I picked a high-powered blue diode laser. I also started making a list of functional requirements.

Week 2

I continued making a list of functional requirements and started making reference sketches. Some functional requirements are at least cutting through 5mm of wood, and if possible, cutting metal. I also did some more research into safety requirements for the laser I picked.

Week 3

I finished the frame and started picking motors for the laser cutters, and added them to the design.

Week 4

Finished version 1 of the design and started looking for electrical parts online, and making the design more cost efficient.

Week 5

Finished the design continued looking for the remaining parts, and started making the BOM

Week 6

Did some touch-ups on the design and found all the parts for it, and finished the BOM.

Total time: 197 hours
