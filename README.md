# laser-cutter

My project is a laser cutter. A laser cutter is a machine that uses a high-powered laser beam to precisely cut or engrave materials like wood, leather, and metal. It works by focusing light into a narrow beam to 
melt, or burn, the material with incredible accuracy. I built a laser cutter to create custom parts, and prototypes at home. It gives me the freedom to design and build everything from engraved gifts to mechanical 
componentsâ€”all with professional precision.
